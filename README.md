# Expression-Calculator
ðŸ“˜ Expression Calculator â€“ Reading Overview
ðŸ”¹ Concept

We are building a calculator that can understand and solve mathematical expressions like:

3 + (4 * 2)


But computers donâ€™t directly understand infix expressions (the normal way we write math).
Instead, they work better with postfix expressions (also called Reverse Polish Notation).

Example:

Infix: 3 + 4 * 2

Postfix: 3 4 2 * +

Postfix is easier for computers because it removes parentheses and precedence confusion.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Requirements

Stack â€“ A data structure where we can push and pop items (Last-In, First-Out).

Used to hold operators (+, -, *, /, %).

Also helps with parentheses.

Infix to Postfix Conversion

Convert human-readable expressions into postfix.

Rules:

Numbers (operands) â†’ go straight to output.

Operators â†’ pushed into stack, but follow precedence (* before +).

Parentheses () â†’ handled specially.

Postfix Evaluation

Take postfix expression and calculate the result using another stack.

ðŸ”¹ Functions Used
1. precedence(op)

Returns priority of operators.

*, /, % â†’ higher precedence.

+, - â†’ lower precedence.

2. infix_to_postfix(expression)

Converts infix expression (normal math) â†’ postfix (machine-friendly).

Uses a stack to store operators.

3. evaluate_postfix(expression)

Solves postfix expression.

Uses a stack for numbers:

Push numbers.

When an operator appears, pop last two numbers, apply operator, push result back.
